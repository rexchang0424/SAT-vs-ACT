# Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

##### Project by: Rex Chang

## Problem Statement

States and schools districts are focusing on assisting the students to be ready for college and career. One of the measurement that evaluating if the students is ready to face any obsticals after high school is the SAT. According to CollegeBoard mission statement for SAT states that "One of our biggest goals in changing the SAT was to make sure itâ€™s highly relevant to your future success. The new test is more focused on the skills and knowledge at the heart of education."[(CollegeBoard)](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat). The test includes reading, writing, and math test to show the college what they've learned from high school and prvoing to the colleges their ability of the overcoming the challenges for the course.

Our objective is to focus on increasing the participation rate in SAT to achieve a higher revenue. This will not only be benefitial to our reputation but also higher acceptance chance for the students to enter better colleges.
In this report we are going to focus on the States of Colorado only, due to the fact that Colorado has the most gain in particiation rate from 2017 to 2018 ;moreoever, the SAT particiaption rate in Colorado increased dramastically whereas ACT decreased. 
 
In response to the reason of this gain, we will observe the reasons for the increase in participation rate. Then apply the result and aid to the states that has lower rate in participation rate in order to maximize our revenue and goal.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

In conclusion, Colorado is one of the Midwestern states that set SAT as a requirement in high school this year. By improving and assisting more student to have greater opportunity for higher education. We should focus on states like Iowa and South Dakota. They have the lowest SAT participation rate, but ACT is not required. 
In the Midwest and South is usually where SAT have the lower participation rate. Therefore, assigning SAT as a mandatory requirement for graduation, similar to what ACT is for 17 different states will benefit student. It allows students to work on SAT practice in school days instead of weekends, where students can have more time participating in extracurricular activities. Making SAT mandatory also provides lower income areas with access to acquiring higher education (ie. SAT provides free testing and Khan Academy resources to allow student to take the test in a more familiar environment.
